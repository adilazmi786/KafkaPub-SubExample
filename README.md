# KafkaPub-SubExample
Kafka: A streaming platform has three key capabilities: 

1.Publish and subscribe to streams of records, similar to a message queue or enterprise messaging system. 

2.Store streams of records in a fault-tolerant durable way. 

3.Process streams of records as they occur.

Kafka is generally used for two broad classes of applications:

Building real-time streaming data pipelines that reliably get data between systems or applications.
Building real-time streaming applications that transform or react to the streams of data.
